    <p>
        A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too
        are words. I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use of new technologies, but
        not the other way around. A Web page tells a great story with great graphical and analytical presentation.

        Using the "View" option look at the source code for this document. The background color and the text declared in
        the
        body refer to a coding system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create
        thousands of possible color choices. The body color indicates white and the text as being black. I could have
        just
        written in "white" and "black" instead of these codes.

    <p> Here is an example of a horizontal rule: </p>
    <hr>

    <p>
        To begin, we can change the
        <h2>
            header size
        </h2>
    </p>

    <p>
        <p>


            and <font color="blue"> color </font>
            <font color="red"> of </font>
            <font color="green"> letters </font>
            seen on the screen. The <font size=10> font size </font>
            can be changed as well, and actually gives more choices.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked
            quote.

            <br>
            <br>

            <font face="arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is the <i> time</i> for all <b>good</b>
                people to <b> come
                </b> to the aid of their
                country. </font>
            <br>
            <br>
            That was also an example of a nested command.
